Open Cloth executables

The C++ projects (except for the CUDA project) have been compiled as 'release' and 'Win32' using Visual Studio VC++ 2010 Express Edition and the executables have been manually copied into this folder.  A copy of the freeglut and glew dlls has also been copied into this folder.
